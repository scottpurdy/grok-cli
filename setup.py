  Grok CLI
  ========

  Included in the Grok CLI package is a `grok` console script, and a reusable
  `grokcli` Python package.  See README.md for usage and additional details.

  Installation notes
  ------------------

  This file (setup.py) is provided to support installation using the native
  python setuptools-based ecosystem, including PyPi, `easy_install` and `pip`.

  Disclaimer:  Your specific environment _may_ require additional arguments to
  pip, setup.py and easy_install such as `--root`, `--install-option`,
  `--script-dir`, `--script-dir`, or you may use `sudo` to install at the system
  level.

  Building source distribution for release
  ----------------------------------------

  The source distribution package is built using the `sdist build` sub-command:

      python setup.py sdist build

  Resulting in the creation of dist/grokcli-1.0.tar.gz, which will be uploaded
  to PyPi (or another distribution channel).  The grokcli package can be
  installed from the tarball directly using a number of approaches:

      pip install grokcli-1.0.tar.gz
      easy_install grokcli-1.0.tar.gz

  Or, by using setup.py:

      tar xzvf grokcli-1.0.tar.gz
      cd grokcli-1.0.tar.gz
      python setup.py install

  Once uploaded to PyPi, grokcli can be installed by name:

      pip install grokcli
      easy_install grokcli

  Alternate installation by `pip wheel`
  -------------------------------------

  Recently, pip has added a new binary distribution format "wheel", which
  simplifies the process somewhat.

  To create a wheel:

      pip wheel .

  Resulting in the creation of wheelhouse/grokcli-1.0-py27-none-any.whl along
  with a few other .whl files related to grokcli dependencies.

  To install from cached wheel:

      pip install --use-wheel --no-index --find-links=wheelhouse/ wheelhouse/grokcli-1.0-py27-none-any.whl

  Or, from PyPi, assuming the wheels have been uploaded to PyPi:

      pip install --use-wheel grokcli


  Uploading to PyPi
  -----------------

  Build and upload source, egg, and wheel distributions to PyPi:

      python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel bdist_egg upload
